Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superpositions, enabling parallel computation. Quantum entanglement and quantum tunneling are exploited to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, quantum decoherence and error correction remain significant challenges in the realization of scalable quantum computers.
